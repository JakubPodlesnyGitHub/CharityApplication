# CharityApplication
## As a solution to the problem presented in the engineering thesis, a web application was created that supports legal entities in managing charitable and non-profit events.

The following project presents the process of creating a web application.
The main purpose of the application is to support and enable entities
better management of the organization and the process of creating new ones
charitable events. The reason for creating the data
application is the desire to reduce the high disproportionality between
events, fundraisers, and events where
the main contribution is the human factor. Selection of the type of application technology
was based on the main advantage of web applications, i.e. easy to use and
wide availability. The entire system architecture was based on Clean
Architecture. The main technology used in the manufacturing process
application from the back-end is C # with the .NET framework, and from
Blazor front-end pages with the MudBlazor framework.
